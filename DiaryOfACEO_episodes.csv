_y_vSmiNpBE,The No.1 Celebrity Therapist: The WEIRD Trick To Get Your Sex Life Back! - Marisa Peer,2023-09-18,"If you are fascinated with learning about the human mind, we recommend you watch this video with Gabor Mate next: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPup-1pDepY 

00:00 Intro

02:05 🙌 You can choose and change your beliefs to shape your reality.
03:01 🧠Question your beliefs and where they came from. Don't be afraid to lie to yourself if it's for your own good. Tell yourself you're going to do well, and you will. Your mind's job is to make your thoughts real. You can trick your mind into not feeling pain.
06:35 🧘🏼‍♀️You can trick your mind into not feeling pain.
07:17 🔁The mind learns by repetition.
11:08 Your brain has the power to change your sex life.
37:04 💡 How to know if you're avoiding something because of trauma or if it's not right for you
37:19 👩‍❤️‍👩 How to pick your battles in a relationship: Focus on meeting your must-have needs and be willing to compromise on the rest.
39:26 💡 How to deal with perfectionism in relationships: Remember that there is no such thing as a perfect partner. Everyone has flaws. Focus on finding someone who loves and accepts you for who you are.
41:32 💃🏼 How to attract the right kind of people: Be yourself and be genuine. People are attracted to those who are authentic. Be realistic about dating apps: Dating apps can be a great way to meet new people, but it's important to be realistic about what to expect. 
45:44 💡 Don't be needy: The most attractive people are those who are happy and fulfilled with their own lives. Don't come across as needy or desperate for a partner.
47:07 🪞 Reflect on your behavior: If you've been unsuccessful in relationships, take some time to reflect on your own behavior. Are there any patterns that you can identify? Once you understand your own patterns, you can start to make changes.
I hope these takeaways are helpful!
49:13 💡 The secret to finding love is to be happy with yourself. Focus on developing a strong sense of self-worth and confidence, and love will follow.
50:50 🧲 Confidence is attractive: People with a strong sense of self are very attractive to others. People can sense that you believe in yourself and that you're comfortable in your own skin, and they're drawn to that.
52:57 💡 Self-esteem comes from within: You can't find self-esteem outside of yourself. It's something that you have to develop from within. This means telling yourself positive things about yourself and believing in your own worth.
58:52 💡 Negative thoughts: Talk yourself out of it, not into it: This means telling yourself that your thoughts are wrong and that you deserve better.
59:59 💡 Understand the root of your cravings:  Once you understand the root of your cravings, you can start to develop strategies for dealing with them in a healthy way.
01:02:48 💡 Choose to love it: If you want to make healthy choices, it's important to choose to love making those choices. This means accepting that you may have to give up some things that you enjoy, but knowing that it's worth it in the long run.
01:03:15 🧠 You're looking for the feeling, not the thing: When you crave something, it's often not the thing itself that you're craving, but the feeling that it represents. 
01:05:19 💡 Review your memories with insight and understanding: If you have negative memories from your childhood, it can be helpful to review them with insight and understanding. This means looking at the memories from a new perspective and trying to understand why they were so painful.
01:07:10 🪞 Tell yourself that you're not that person with cravings anymore. The best way to deal with temptation is to become indifferent to it. 
01:12:28 🧠 Hypnosis can help you change your relationship with food: Hypnosis can help you to change your relationship with food and to overcome cravings. It can help you to understand the root of your cravings and to develop new, healthier relationships with food.
